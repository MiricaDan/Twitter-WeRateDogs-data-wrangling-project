# WeRateDogs Twitter account data wrangling project
### by Daniel Mirica


## Introduction

The project is related to the WeRateDogs Twitter account data and focuses mainly on the data wrangling part of the overall data analysis process. The data is gathered from a couple of sources (csv files, cloud stored files and pulled directly from the Twitter API), assessed visually and programatically, cleaned with the help of multiple Python libraries and finally merged into a combined dataset. A brief analysis aided by visualizations is provided based on the findings from the final dataset. 

## Project details

### Data wrangling, which consists of:

* Gathering data
* Assessing data
* Cleaning data
* Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data

### Gathering Data
Reporting on 1) data wrangling efforts and 2) data analyses and visualizations. Three pieces of data were gathered in a Jupyter Notebook titled `wrangle_act.ipynb`:

### Assessing Data
After gathering the data, visual and programmatic assessments were conducted to identify quality and tidiness issues. 

### Cleaning Data
Cleaned each of the issues documented while assessing. This resulted in a high quality and tidy master pandas DataFrame.

### Storing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Data 
Stored the clean DataFrame in a CSV file. Analyzed and visualized the wrangled data in the`wrangle_act.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. Created a written report called `act_report.ipynb` that communicates the insights and displays the visualizations produced in a more blog post fashion. This can be further displayed in a .html or .pdf format.

### Reporting 
Created a written report called `wrangle_report.ipynb` that briefly describes the wrangling efforts. To be used only as an internal document.
